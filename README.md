Welcome to **College Simulator**! This interactive Python game puts you in the shoes of a college student navigating the challenges of course selection, studying, social life, and stress management. Your decisions determine your academic success, social standing, and overall well-being.


#Branching explained:
This game uses **branching logic** in multiple ways:
The first major branch occurs when you choose your course load (light, standard, or heavy).
Your subject selection demonstrates both membership and logical operators
Input for extra hours is validated and then processed with conditional logic to adjust your GPA based on your effort and current standing.
The `if current_gpa >= 3` condition at the end determines whether you "pass the semester" or "fail the semester," representing the game's primary endings.

#How to run the game:
you will have to clone or download the respitory 
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.  
In your terminal or command prompt, type:
bash Python Isaiah24Coleman_assignemtn_3.py
   
Then follow the on-screen prompts and make your choices!

#Endings explained:
**Pass the Semester:**  
  If your GPA reaches 3.0 or higher, you successfully pass.
**Fail the Semester:**  
  If your GPA is below 3.0, you do not pass.

## AI Assistance Used
Used co- pliot and chat gpt just to look over my code, i did my code with
my upswing tutor where we got all the code to run. I spent most of my ai time 
figuring out how to use my github
